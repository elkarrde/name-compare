 *  FuzzyMatch.apply is a method for comparing 2 names, that uses Levenshtein algorithm.
 *  The Levenshtein algorithm (also called Edit-Distance) calculates the
 *  least number of edit operations that are necessary to modify one string to become an another string.
 *
 *  Method FuzzyMatch.apply returns 0 to 1 correlation between 2 names.
 *
 *  Names, that are used for fuzzy matching previously are:
 *
 *  1. Transliterated
 *  2. Alphabetically sorted
 *  3. Converted to lowercase and trimmed for extra whitespaces
 *
 *  Additionally, specialised handlers have been created for special cases of names
 *  containing hyphens or names which have been shortened to initials.
 *
 *  A live demo of this code is available on the Instantor sandbox server at:
 *  https://platform.instantor.com/sandbox/name-compare/
